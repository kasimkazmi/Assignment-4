**Technologies **

**Server** NodeJS

**Client** Postman 

**Database** MongoDB/Mongoose

 

**Task **

Create a NodeJS implementation of the server components required to provide data from a MongoDB database instance to the Javascript client described in Assignment 1.

 

To complete this project, you will need database entities like the following:

• Product (description, image, pricing, shipping cost)

• User (email, password, username, purchase history, shipping address)

• Comments (product, user, rating, image(s), text)

• Cart (products, quantities, user)

• Order (recording of a sale)

  

You will test your project using Postman to validate your endpoints behave appropriately in both success and failure cases. Provide captured test output as part of your assignment submission.
